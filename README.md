Started with creating a plane. As I know the importance of it's state will be important later on, I implimented this straight away.
Next Started work on the airport. We need to able to store a plane somewhere... hangers with an empty state. There's no planes in there yet. Obvs.

Airport (being the magical being it is) asks a lonely plane to join them. It complies.

Airport has an array which stores planes. Now has the ability to have one of the planes removed.
